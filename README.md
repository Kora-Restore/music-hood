\# Music-Hood



A local-first, folder-based music player for desktop systems.



Music-Hood exists because mobile apps like Musicolet proved that:

\- fast

\- local

\- metadata-driven

\- no-account

\- no-cloud



music players can be \*good\*.



Desktop forgot.



\## Core Principles



\- \*\*Local-first\*\*  

&nbsp; Plays files from folders you own. No libraries locked behind databases.



\- \*\*No accounts, no telemetry, no DRM\*\*

&nbsp; Ever.



\- \*\*Folder truth\*\*

&nbsp; Your filesystem \*is\* the source of truth, not an internal index.



\- \*\*Fast by default\*\*

&nbsp; Startup in milliseconds, not seconds.



\- \*\*Explicit actions\*\*

&nbsp; Nothing runs in the background without the user choosing it.



\## Scope (Initial)



\- Local playback (MP3, FLAC, M4A, OGG, WAV)

\- Folder-based browsing

\- Playlists as files (M3U / M3U8)

\- Keyboard-first navigation



\## Future (Opt-in)



\- YouTube audio extraction using user-provided tools

\- Batch downloads into local folders

\- Metadata editing

\- Cross-platform (Windows / Linux first)



\## Non-Goals



\- Streaming services

\- Social features

\- Recommendation engines

\- Ads

\- “AI DJ”

\- Electron bloat



\## Philosophy



This is not a product.

This is infrastructure for people who already own their music.



If you’re looking to monetize attention, you’re in the wrong place.
