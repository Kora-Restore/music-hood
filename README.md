# Music-Hood

A local-first, folder-based music player for Windows/Linux with an optional YouTube audio capture helper.

## What this is
- A desktop app that treats your folders as the source of truth.
- Fast library scan, great search, playlists as files, no cloud dependency.
- Optional helper: one-click YouTube (yt-dlp) audio extraction into your library.

## What this is NOT
- A streaming service.
- A DRM bypass toolkit.
- A tracker.

## Core principles
- Local-first by default
- Privacy by design
- Transparent file structure
- Cross-platform parity (Win + Linux)
