# UX Mapping: Musicolet → Desktop

## What Musicolet gets right
1. **Speed**: everything is one gesture away.
2. **Queue as a first-class citizen**: queue is not a hidden mode, it's the core.
3. **Folder-first reality**: many people organize via folders, not “albums”.
4. **Batch actions**: multi-select and apply.
5. **Non-annoying defaults**: app doesn't fight your intentions.

## Desktop translation rules
### 1) One window, 3 panes (optional)
- **Left**: Library navigation (Folders / Artists / Albums / Playlists / Search)
- **Center**: Track list (current view)
- **Right**: Queue + Now Playing + mini controls

Panes can collapse. Default on laptop: two panes (Left + Center); Queue slides in.

### 2) Queue always visible (or one key away)
- Queue toggle: `Q`
- Queue is editable: reorder, remove, save as playlist.

### 3) Search is global and instant
- Focus search: `Ctrl+K`
- Search applies across library + playlists + queue.

### 4) Actions live where the hand already is
- Right click = contextual actions
- Keyboard = same actions via shortcuts
- Multi-select by Shift/Ctrl, then apply actions.

### 5) Folder-first without being dumb
- A folder is a “collection”. It can also be tagged to artists/albums.
- Never force a re-org.
- Provide optional “virtual views” (Artist/Album) derived from tags.

## “Feels like Musicolet” checklist
- Add-to-queue is always faster than “play now”
- Multi-select is painless
- Queue editing is frictionless
- Folder navigation doesn’t punish the user
